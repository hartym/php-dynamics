Contribute
==========

So you want to contribute?

Welcome!

Your options
::::::::::::

Many contributions type are welcome.

* **Core code** contribution, **documentation** contributions

  You can either send me patches by mail (at romain.dorgueil@dakrazy.net), or
  send me a git pull request (a mail saying "hey, I'd love you to fetch/merge
  from this url, thanks).

  You can also send me pull requests directly on github, if you prefer.

* **Bug reports, failing tests cases**

  You can report issues in redmine issue, with or without attached test case,
  of course test case is prefered).

  If you ahve a patch, even not perfect, feel free to attach it too.

* :term:`Packageset` maintainers

  You're using a js framework which is not yet preconfigured in a
  :term:`packageset` repository?

  Feel free to start a git repository which contains it, when you'll feel it's
  mature enough, we'll clone it on the official dynamics github repository, for
  convenience. Your repository will remain the main one.

  You want to help maintaining/improve an existing :term:`packageset`?

  The best option you have is to contact the actual maintainer to propose him
  some help.

* Have an amazing idea? Anything that does not fit there? We must have forgot
  this one, feel free to drop a message/patch/hint/flame (well no, avoid the
  last one unless constructive).

Quality
:::::::

We want to keep a great software quality. For this, please take some time to
write documentation, to check coding standards, and to think about your code.

Try to write short methods, prefer instance methods over static, never use the
terrible error-sinker arobas.

Try to separate concerns, and write unit tests.

For the rest, just rely on other developpers opinions, ask them comments on
your patches, and make comments on their patches. Git is amazing to do so, so
let's take advantage of our mutual experiences.
