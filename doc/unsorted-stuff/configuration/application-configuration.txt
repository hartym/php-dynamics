# Customize behavior in app.yml

For each applications using sfDynamics, you can use the `app.yml` file (under
%sf_app_dir%/config) to customize the default behavior of the plugin.

Everything is under the `sfDynamicsPlugin` section, and everything has a
default value.

## Supercache web path

This directive let you choose the name of the directory under %sf_web_dir% in
which the assets supercache will be.

Default value: dynamics

### Example

    [yaml]
    all:
      sfDynamicsPlugin:
        supercache_web_path: assets

Packed and grouped assets will be put under `%sf_root_dir%/web/medias`. This
must be a directory and must be web server writable (the plugin will attempt to
create it and chmod it, but this is a bit bogus and may be removed in a future
release).

## Assets position in head

This directive let you choose if the assets must be loaded at the beginning or
at the end of the <head> tag.

Possible values: append, prepend

Default value: append

### Example

    [yaml]
    all:
      sfDynamicsPlugin:
        assets_position_in_head: prepend

The <script> and <link> tags for assets inclusion will be included just after
the <head> tag, instead of just before the </head> tag.

## Concatenated javascript and stylesheet filter chains (since 0.9.5)

Those directives (`concatenated_javascript_filter_chain` and `concatenated_stylesheet_filter_chain`)
let you override default javascript and stylesheets filters. For example, you can use
your own javascript packer, or process stylesheets, by creating your own `sfDynamicsBaseAssetFilter`
subclass.

Possible values: array of `sfDynamicsBaseAssetFilter` subclass names.

Default value for javascripts: ['sfDynamicsJSMinJavascriptFilter'] 
Default value for stylesheets: ['sfDynamicsSimpleStylesheetFilter'] 

### Example

    [yaml]
    all:
      sfDynamicsPlugin:
        concatenated_javascript_filter_chain:
          - sfDynamicsExperimentalClosureAPIJavascriptFilter

Instead of using the JSMin packer, prefer using the google closure API (via
HTTP POST) to pack the scripts. (not recommended)

## Experimental relative paths resolution

Undocumented yet.

Default value: false

## Enable cache (as of 0.9.5)

Don't change this unless you know what you're doing.

## Enable supercache (as of 0.9.5)

Don't change this unless you know what you're doing.
