# Tutorial Part 2 - Installation

We're going to write a brand new symfony project to try out the plugin. Just
create a new directory, and initialize an empty project.  You should already be
familiar with the symfony version (1.1, 1.2, or 1.3) you're using.

## Let's get it..

First of all we need to install the plugin. You have few different options that
are available to install the plugin. The easiest one is to use the
`plugin:install` task to get the latest version:

    [shell]
    $ ./symfony plugin:install sfDynamicsPlugin --stability=alpha

Other options include setting the svn:externals property of your plugin
directory to a svn tag, or to the svn trunk, and pulling directly from the git
repository. We won't dive into detailed explanations about this.

## Additional steps

The most important additional step there is to create an apache-writeable
%sf_web_dir%/dynamics directory, which will be used for grouped assets
supercache. For now, this is not configurable but it will be soon.

    [shell]
    $ mkdir web/dynamics
    $ chmod 777 web/dynamics

Now, you can add the `sfDynamics` module in the enabled_modules setting of your
application's setting. The `sfDynamics` module is the rendering gateway needed
to compile/pack/shrink/expand/crush your assets. Just remember that without a

As of symfony 1.2, you also have to activate the plugin by editing your
`config/ProjectConfiguration.class.php` and adding the following line where
relevant (if you don't know where this is, you should consider grabbing some
informations about symfony first).

    [php]
    $this->enablePlugins(array('sfDynamicsPlugin'));

## Check everything is ok

*This part of the tutorial needs to be written*

You're now ready to take one step further and [start using dynamics in your
first project](/documentation/tutorial-03_start_using_dynamics).
